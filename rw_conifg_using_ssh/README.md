# Explanation of how this code works:

# File ip_file_valifity.py-----------------------

1. **Checking File Validity:**
- The program prompts the user to enter the path and filename of the IP address file using the `input()` function.
- The function `os.path.isfile(ip_add_file)` is used to check if the file exists at the provided location.
- If the file exists, it prints "file is valid". If not, it prints "file is not valid" and exits the program using `sys.exit()`.
 - The program prompts the user to enter the path and filename of the IP address file using the `input()` function.
- The function `os.path.isfile(ip_add_file)` is used to check if the file exists at the provided location.
 - If the file exists, it prints "file is valid". If not, it prints "file is not valid" and exits the program using `sys.exit()`.

2. **Reading IP Addresses:**
 - Once the file is validated, the file is opened in read mode using `with open(ip_add_file, 'r')`.
- `f.seek(0)` moves the cursor to the beginning of the file.
- `f.readlines()` reads the content of the file line by line and stores it in the list `ip_add_list`. Each line corresponds to an IP address.

3. **Returning IP Addresses:**
- The list `ip_add_list`, which now contains all the IP addresses read from the file, is returned by the function.

4. **Test Example:**
 - You can test this function by calling it and printing the returned list, like so:
    Example usage:
        ip_list = ip_file_valid()
        print(ip_list)


# ip_add_validity.py-----------------------

### How It Works:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `ip_addr_valid(ip_add_list)` accepts a list of IP addresses as input. The list contains IPs in string format, like `["192.168.0.1\n"]`.

2. **Removing Newline Character:**
   - Inside the loop, `ip.rstrip("\n")` is used to remove any newline character (`\n`) that is added by the `f.readlines()` method when reading the file.

3. **Splitting IP Address into Octets:**
   - Each IP address is split by periods (`.`) using `ip.split('.')`, which results in a list of octets (e.g., `['192', '168', '0', '1']`).

4. **Octet Validity Check:**
   - The function performs several checks on the IP address:
     - The address must have 4 octets (`len(octet_list) == 4`).
     - The first octet must be in the range 1-223, excluding multicast addresses and loopback addresses.
     - The address must not be part of the `169.254.x.x` range (APIPA).
     - All octets must be in the range 0-255.

5. **Invalid IP Handling:**
   - If an IP address does not pass the checks, the program prints an error message and stops using `sys.exit()`.

6. **Valid IP Handling:**
   - If the IP address is valid, the program continues to the next address without printing anything.



7. How to Use and Set Up:

- Save this module as `ip_add_validity.py` (or any name you prefer).
- Import the `ip_file_valid` function from `ip_file_validity.py` to get the list of IP addresses.
- Call the function `ip_addr_valid(ip_add_list)` with the list of IP addresses you want to validate.
- If all IPs are valid, the program continues without printing anything.
- If an invalid IP is found, the program exits and displays an error message with the invalid IP.



# cred_file_valid.py-----------------------

### **Summary: Checking File Availability for Login Credentials**

The `cred_file_valid` function is responsible for verifying the availability of a file containing login credentials (username and password) for devices. It ensures that the specified file exists at the given location before proceeding.

#### **How It Works:**
1. The user is prompted to input the path and filename of the credentials file.
2. The function uses `os.path.isfile()` to check if the specified file exists:
   - If the file exists:
     - A message confirms the file's validity.
   - If the file does not exist:
     - A message indicates the file is invalid.
     - The program exits using `sys.exit()` to prevent further execution.

#### **Purpose:**
This function is critical for validating that the credentials file is present and accessible. Without this check, subsequent operations requiring the file's content could fail.

#### **Example Usage:**
```python
cred_file_valid()
```
When called, the function prompts the user to input the path of the credentials file and validates its existence. This ensures that the necessary login credentials are available for authentication.

# ip_reachablity.py-----------------------
### **Summary: Checking IP Reachability**

The `ip_reach` function is designed to verify the reachability of a list of IP addresses by using the `ping` command. This function ensures that all specified devices are reachable on the network before proceeding with further operations.

#### **How It Works:**
1. The function takes a list of IP addresses (`ip_add_list`) as input.
2. For each IP address:
   - It removes any trailing newline characters using `rstrip("\n")`.
   - Executes the `ping` command with the IP address using `subprocess.call()`.
     - Sends 2 ICMP packets (`/n 2`) to the target IP.
     - Suppresses the command output and errors by redirecting `stdout` and `stderr` to `subprocess.DEVNULL`.
3. Based on the `ping` response:
   - If `ping_reply == 0`, the IP is reachable, and a success message is displayed.
   - If `ping_reply != 0`, the IP is unreachable, and the program terminates with an error message using `sys.exit()`.

#### **Purpose:**
This function ensures that all devices in the given list are accessible on the network, which is critical for any subsequent operations that rely on communication with these devices.

#### **Example Usage:**
```python
ip_add_list = ["192.168.0.1\n", "10.0.0.1\n"]
ip_reach(ip_add_list)
```
- This example checks the reachability of the specified IPs.
- If all IPs are reachable, the program proceeds.
- If any IP is unreachable, an error message is displayed, and the program exits.

#### **Key Notes:**
- **`subprocess.call()`:** Executes the `ping` command and waits for it to complete.
- **Return Codes:**
  - `0`: Ping successful.
  - Non-zero: Ping failed.
- **Output Suppression:** `subprocess.DEVNULL` prevents console clutter by suppressing command output and errors.
