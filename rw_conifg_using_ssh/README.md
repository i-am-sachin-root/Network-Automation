# Explanation of how this code works:

# File ip_file_valifity.py--------------------------

1. **Checking File Validity:**
- The program prompts the user to enter the path and filename of the IP address file using the `input()` function.
- The function `os.path.isfile(ip_add_file)` is used to check if the file exists at the provided location.
- If the file exists, it prints "file is valid". If not, it prints "file is not valid" and exits the program using `sys.exit()`.
 - The program prompts the user to enter the path and filename of the IP address file using the `input()` function.
- The function `os.path.isfile(ip_add_file)` is used to check if the file exists at the provided location.
 - If the file exists, it prints "file is valid". If not, it prints "file is not valid" and exits the program using `sys.exit()`.

2. **Reading IP Addresses:**
 - Once the file is validated, the file is opened in read mode using `with open(ip_add_file, 'r')`.
- `f.seek(0)` moves the cursor to the beginning of the file.
- `f.readlines()` reads the content of the file line by line and stores it in the list `ip_add_list`. Each line corresponds to an IP address.

3. **Returning IP Addresses:**
- The list `ip_add_list`, which now contains all the IP addresses read from the file, is returned by the function.

4. **Test Example:**
 - You can test this function by calling it and printing the returned list, like so:
    Example usage:
        ip_list = ip_file_valid()
        print(ip_list)


# ip_add_validity.py-----------------------

### How It Works:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `ip_addr_valid(ip_add_list)` accepts a list of IP addresses as input. The list contains IPs in string format, like `["192.168.0.1\n"]`.

2. **Removing Newline Character:**
   - Inside the loop, `ip.rstrip("\n")` is used to remove any newline character (`\n`) that is added by the `f.readlines()` method when reading the file.

3. **Splitting IP Address into Octets:**
   - Each IP address is split by periods (`.`) using `ip.split('.')`, which results in a list of octets (e.g., `['192', '168', '0', '1']`).

4. **Octet Validity Check:**
   - The function performs several checks on the IP address:
     - The address must have 4 octets (`len(octet_list) == 4`).
     - The first octet must be in the range 1-223, excluding multicast addresses and loopback addresses.
     - The address must not be part of the `169.254.x.x` range (APIPA).
     - All octets must be in the range 0-255.

5. **Invalid IP Handling:**
   - If an IP address does not pass the checks, the program prints an error message and stops using `sys.exit()`.

6. **Valid IP Handling:**
   - If the IP address is valid, the program continues to the next address without printing anything.



7. How to Use and Set Up:

- Save this module as `ip_add_validity.py` (or any name you prefer).
- Import the `ip_file_valid` function from `ip_file_validity.py` to get the list of IP addresses.
- Call the function `ip_addr_valid(ip_add_list)` with the list of IP addresses you want to validate.
- If all IPs are valid, the program continues without printing anything.
- If an invalid IP is found, the program exits and displays an error message with the invalid IP.
